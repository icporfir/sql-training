# SQL Journey 

I started this repository on **2025-09-01** to track my daily practice and progress in SQL.  
The goal of this repo is to document my learning path as I build towards professional **SQL certifications** and strengthen my database skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `practice/` â†’ Daily or topic-based `.sql` files with examples, exercises, and notes.
- `projects/` â†’ Larger practice projects or case studies using sample data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Master SQL fundamentals: `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Work with advanced queries: subqueries, CTEs, window functions
- Practice real-world scenarios: reporting, analytics, and data cleaning
- Prepare for recognized SQL/database certifications

## âœ… Commit Style
Each commit reflects what I learned on a given day (or topic).  
File names follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.sql`.

ðŸ’¡ This repo is both my personal notebook and a showcase of consistent learning.
